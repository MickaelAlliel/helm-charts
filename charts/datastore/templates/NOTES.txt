Rookout's datastore is a component that saves messages from your app and serves them to our web-IDE in 
      https://app.rookout.com/

To make sure that the datastore is connected to your installed controller, 
your org admin should visit https://app.rookout.com and set the datastore url in the Data-On-prem tab under Breakpoint settings.

After that, put a new breakpoint to see the magic happen!
